FileIndex
=================================================

![Points](../../blob/badges/points.svg)

For this homework, you will create a class that implements the `ForwardIndex` interface and provide a missing `default` implementations in the `ForwardIndex` interface itself.

## Hints ##

Below are some hints that may help with this homework assignment:

  - The code **will not compile** until you implement the `ForwardIndex` interface in the `FileIndex` class for `Path` objects properly.

  - When creating a default implementation, you can call other methods in the interface even if they are not implemented.

  - Most of the implementations require 1 to 3 lines of code.

  - ::warning:: This homework helps you think about design for the project, but **should not be used directly** in your project. Your project requires an *inverted* index (the word is indexed), and this homework is a *forward* index (the location is indexed). 

These hints are *optional*. There may be multiple approaches to solving this homework.

## Instructions ##

Use the "Tasks" view in Eclipse to find the `TODO` comments for what need to be implemented and the "Javadoc" view to see additional details.

The tests are provided in the `src/test/` directory; do not modify any of the files in that directory. Check the run details on GitHub Actions for how many points each test group is worth. 

See the [Homework Resources](https://usf-cs272-spring2023.github.io/resources/homework/) for additional details on homework requirements and submission.
